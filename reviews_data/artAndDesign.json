Along with the Infinite Painter app. BOTH were awesome but unfortunately I have had multiple errors with Infinite design recently. Just in the last month I the app failed while trying to work on a project that is much smaller than others I have done with this app in the past. The first error locked me out and didn't recognize me as a paid user, which I have been for a handful of years. I had to re-install the app to get it to recognize my credentials. Perhaps my bad, but the uninstall process took with it my saved projects that weren't exported to SVG or PNG. Those were gone and unrecoverable. I started the project over again and near completion most of the layers I had cleared themselves and hours and hours of work was lost. I have reached out via their email because their forum won't let me create an account and they basically gave me a response that sounded like it was blaming me for their apps inability to function. It pains me to walk away from Infinite Design. It was the best Vector drawing app but 2 losses in a month and a loss at the end of last year has taught me I can not rely on this app for projects anymore. Apart from that some of the functions in the app have started to work differently or fail over the years. I wonder if there is enough upkeep. Using the lazy function or smooth function don't work as well as they used to. I was down to drawing my lines by hand in the app when I wanted them and exporting to SVG to clean up in a program on my PC. I hope this changes for the future."},

In my opinion this app is mediocre, the brushes are ok, but most of them aren't very good. Most of the brushes you have to pay for, you only get around 4 for each category. The design of the toolbar is ok, but I don't like that you have to tap on it everytime you want to use it. The undo, the undo is very annoying, 1:it is in a place that is hard to access, 2: you have to pay to get more undo. That's not very user friendly, undo is one of the most nessarray tools for an artist. Thanks!"},

My device is quite slow in general. And it takes ages to open the app. In that case, the ONLY thing that will fix it is reopening the app."},

Everything seems so good except a few annoying things. 1. I have set long press to eye dropper, and I use it all the time. The problem is when I have to use move tool or distort tool, while I'm trying to make fine adjustments, eye dropper gets activated. This shouldn't be the case. When tools similar to move is active, long press shouldn't bring up eye dropper, because that's not anyone's intent to sample colors with move tool ON. 2. The layer pane can be expanded or collapsed, this is nice on small screen devices. On larger screens at least give an option to lock the layer pane in expanded mode. I can't use swipe gesture on layers to clip/unclip, or delete layer when the pane is switching between expanded and collapsed. This is so annoying. I have unlocked everything after the trial period, these two issues are so annoying. Please disable eye dropper when move tool is ON and give an option to lock the layer pane."},

Fortunately, I had the artworks stored in my gallery. The app is great overall but please fix this!"},

You can change the type of effect you want a certain tool has by changing the mode from \"standard\" to anything else. This app is really nice \ud83d\udd8c\ufe0f\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udfa8"},
