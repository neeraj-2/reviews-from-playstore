All the features are so detailed. I love how I can see the drawings of the constellations, can browse through heavenly bodies including man-made satellites and even see when I can see them at my selected location. I also like how we have a description about everything. Don't even get me started about how many options we have for landscapes, grids, night vision, and atmospheric view! \ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29 The app is quite user-friend, great for beginner and intermediate astronomers!

Just one question: For satellites, would it be possible to add the magnitude value as a second curve to the object's visibility-over-time plot? The object visibility plots are really great and offer a lot of detail of the selected object, but I feel like they don't help you much if you want to determine if you can actually see the satellite. Mag info over time would we a great thing to have! Possible? Visibility plot is a feature of the plus version, but it seems that if you purchase in-app-monthly google does not let you write a review for the plus version in the store, so I am trying to reach you here. Since I am mainly interested in satellites, the mag feature would make the difference for me to keep the subscription/ buy the plus app. Thanks for reading my review and for developing such a great tool."},

Happily choose it over other star maps apps. There are however two downsides: 1. The distance between the horizon and the stellar objects is not accurate. There is a difference of about 5 to 10 degrees. It's pretty annoying if you're trying to hunt planets or objects that are near the horizon when planning observing sessions. 2. In the paid version, the settings for star magnitude do not save if app is closed and needs to be reset manually."},

This free version is pretty complete and has enough features for someone who wants to learn about the constellations and planets. It is very easy to use and attractive. The Plus version adds telescope control, light pollution adjustment, many more stars (most invisible to the naked eye), and other functions. I had stopped using Stellarium a few years ago and moved to a newer, more complete (but more complicated) app. Although Stellarium has fewer features than other apps, it presents information in a very intuitive way. As a result of the update, I will start using Stellarium again when I want a look at the night sky. Also, I used their support email and their support is excellent. One improvement that I would like to see is to show the magnitude of an object that I select without having to slide the information panel up to see the object's magnitude."},

Tests should have some more questions and randomize on retake to certain extent."},

A learning app has to substitute for a tuition, especially in this lockdown period. There are no chapters or set syllabus to study. There are only live classes at random times and on random subjects. And most of these live classes are really, really useless. Trust me, try Toppr. It's much better."},

I paid for Vendantu pro...with a tempting discount offer and after payment was through, found it was 'lite'version,(this was not shown in advance that it was the 'lite' version, it said pro and. 2. Immediately after paying for 1 month, I found that just by downloading the app I would have got free 30 days (I've just paid minutes back). Pl adjust my paid month to start after 30 free days as offered to all and pl tell me how much to pay to top up to pro proper. The quality of the one free class I attended was superb, I liked that. The purchase process, I didn't like, I didn't mind paying but to find it was lite, then that I paid but could have got free, immediately after, doesn't feel good...purchase process needs improvement to prevent the immediate post purchase desonance! After all, you have a very good product. Please revert on the above. Thank you"},

On a cold night of AP it is easy to push the wrong part of the screen and lose what you are targeting, zoom in x100, or completely do a 180 on the sky. Suggestions: lose the zoom sounds because as I said above, on a phone with a smaller screen it is easy to hit the zoom buttons accidently and the VvvrroooOoom spacy Kubrick sounds scare the baggeesus out of me. Also have a default zoom buttons we can set. That would be so handy. Making the sky 'turn' with less touch sensitivity would be nice since like on these cold nights it is easy to over swipe and end up on Gemini when you meant to get on Orion. The guiding arrow for searching also shouldn't disappear once you frame your target with the phone/tablets sensors. It should lock until I tell it not to. Overall great app and worth every penny."},

So many entities (companies) are using it as a way to promote themselves, by leaving out bad information. And if you try to update a wiki page, they won't post it if it is even slightly negative. In other words, wikipedia has become a platform whose motto is \"If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all\". So, a lot of information on wikipedia is now so filtered and so politically correct, that it does not paint an accurate picture.

But the reasons for 3 stars are- 1. The absence of a search option to find old assignments. 2. The absence of dark mode. 3. After the new update, the notification panel was also removed not being a great idea. 4. Sometimes the work which has to be submitted, takes a long time of about 5-10 mins. to be handed in although my network is proper and file is also not big. Please try to add and improve the above mentioned features."},

Over two months and I still don't understand how the language I'm \"learning\" functionally works... There's a lot of neat graphics and it kinda feels like a game... but you'll be hounded to upgrade to Plus nonstop. Can't really say that I recommend this learning platform."},

The games are great fun although it's slightly addictive. I love the challenges and earning badges along the way. The free version is okay. You need to earn hearts to take lessons, when you make a mistake, you lose a heart. To earn hearts, simply do a practice lesson. It's a great way to get lots of practice in the free version."},

It won't help with the Chinese writing system (memorization of characters), but gives a lot of sentence structure. Need other apps to build on vocabulary. For the Chinese language, simply need to understand the radicals and components of characters. And for the Russian language, you really need a separate app for vocabulary builder."},

More ads, more things you have to pay for. It also is purposely telling me my answer is wrong so I lose hearts. It says the correct answer should be...and then gives you the wrong answer even though you pick the right one. This app is terrible for anyone who doesn't know the language and will tell you the wrong info!!"},

Duolingo should encourage you to learn a new language, but now it makes you feel like you're not allowed to make mistakes and you have to stop after 5 mistakes. I know this isn't a feature on laptop but I usually use my phone and then it sucks. With that it's also very difficult to reach XP goals or to promote in leagues."},

On the other hand, gamification is great and it isn't necessary to pay for additional stuff to use application. Also, it's good for learning vocabulary, it is very easy to learn and remember words. The pronunciation is also great, you can listen and repeat whole sentences. Unfortunately, in my case sometimes the speaking exercise malfunction and I have to skip them."},

It's lacking a bit in the Korean in that the pronunciation isn't consistent and some of the phonetic examples don't make sense. (\"'R' as in kiTTy\") The app starts right in on units when it should start on the alphabet and some of the alphabet lessons get ahead of the rules so it's confusing at times. However this is the best one I've seen and when I get a bit deeper in, it will be worth the subscription fee."},

Slowly but surely. Sometimes the repetition can be a bit much (how many ways can I say \"my cat is eating a croissant\"?) but I understand that repetition works. Some of the Bot voices are irritating (Lily) and a bit unclear, but again, it still works. The ads aren't invasive. I don't like that the free app only allows 3 mistakes before you can't practice anymore (unless you buy or earn more hearts). I've tried the premium, it's better, but expensive."},

It won't make you a master, but you also won't be lost when traveling. So set your expectations correctly. Also would benefit from having an introduction to the alphabet in the beginning. It really helps with pronunciation. **The App: Voice exercises get annoying sometimes when the last word is not long (eg. Hoy in Spanish), and the app can't recognize it when spoken."},

Third, there are glitches with the audio on two levels. The first is the app's inability to recognize the spoken word \u2014 uno, dos, tres, for example. The other is that the app voices are often unclear \u2014 dropping esses off the end of words. I've run out of space.\ud83d\ude44"},

But I have one issue regrading the rubric, as a teacher if there is a option to download the marks which is provided by teacher in the rubric for each and every student as well as for all students in classroom for those the test is assigned, It would be more helpful for the teachers to evaluate the performance of students easily. So kindly try to enable this option of downloading the marks in rubric. Thank you"},

It also doesn't show the exact time & date an assignment, post, or a comment was posted, this fact is super disappointing, and really makes this app look very cheapskate. I really hope this app gets updated soon as this is not what I expected from Google LLC."},
