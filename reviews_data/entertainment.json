It always lags whenever I try to watch a movie or a show. And ever since the \"Advertisements\" have come into play, it only worsens it further. So much for having an \"Ad-Free\" experience on purchasing subscription. At least try to give an option to \"Skip Ads\" if you can't remove them completely. And try to improve the app in terms of load time and speed, it needs serious improvements."},

No, it is an ad streaming platform. Whenever I touch anywhere on the screen, 2 ads pop-up that you can't even skip.

This is for the design of Tata Sky Remote. The design of your remote is too bad because buttons are placed in a very confusing way. specially the Blue arrow buttons for navigating are surrounded by black buttons such as back, mute, help, vol & channel up & down, fav and home. Many a times when trying to navigate through channels info people accidentally press back and other buttons that are surrounded. All the buttons are many a times too tiny for many fingers. Request the team to keep the design a bit more simple. Also the UI that is displayed in TV while navigating has the following issues : 1. While pressing the info button in any channel, all the text is of same size, there is no typographical hierarchy as to display important things in a highlighted way. Many a times its too fuzzy and the design isn't properly hierarchical. 2. There isn't an easy way to create favorite channels. Every body cannot navigate through all the stuff because elders at our home may not be able to go through all the complex processes like going every time through guides and keep on selecting options. 3. Navigating through the channels is too tiresome presently. Tata always cares for customer feedback, hope this also is considered in a favorable way."},

If there haven't been any clips in past 24 hours, the default makes it appear that there are no clips. Viewer has to change it to \"all time\" to see more.

For example, it's hard to get 'zems' because you cannot earn some from selling your items and you can only get it if you buy it, play a certain game, or do the quest. There are also too much OVERPRICED items with zems as price. Not only that, when playing you get stuck running in place if you don't jump over a certain step. If you can, please fix this immediately, it's slowly ruining the game."},

I only give 4 stars though due to the fact that things are a little overpriced along with the occasional glitches that occur. Zepeto is good at fixing them quickly though but there will always be a few that they can't, personally for me the game fails to load a lot so I do have to restart it.

It's easy to operate and it's just adorable. However, the items are just insanely expensive. All the good stuff can only be paid by ZEM, and we can get the ZEM by buying it. Which is also expensive. I don't think I would spend that much for just a virtual world game. The rest can be bought by coins, but coins are not easy to get either. Too bad, this game has so much potential, but end up to be just not worth it."},

My only hang-up is that buying assets does add up. Maybe there could be promotional events where certain items are free for a while?

Nevertheless, I would like to recommend if you could somehow beautify the chat box designs. Since it's a social media platform, it'll be reasonable to do so. These are my recommendations; - Chat colors - Chat nicknames - Delete message option - Search in conversation option - Emojis, stickers and GIFs So far, there is not a week that I don't use this app. Also, most of my recommendations are based on personal favors \ud83d\ude06.

Also if you have your account on there. And you delete an app with your Google Play Games account on it. And you delete the game. And then you reinstall it with your account on it. It will save your progress!! \ud83d\ude42 And you can get achievements. I don't know what they really do except for level you up and give you XP.
