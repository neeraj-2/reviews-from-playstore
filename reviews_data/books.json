I had no complaints about it in the beginning. But now when I read a story which is ongoing it shows the writer uploaded new chapter in the list but when I click on that it shows the writer has not uploaded. And for this I have to uninstall the app again install it for getting the new chapters. Even after regularly updating the app it shows the same problem. Please look at this. It's my heartfelt request to you guys...Hope you'll solve this problem soon"},

It was the first one I tried and I've looked for other apps like it too, but none are as good as this one. I like it a lot. But there are some glitches that i wish good be repaired. Sometimes when i try to upload pictures on my chapters, the pics either double up and or just disappears when I put them from my storage. Apart from all these, wattpad is really great\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb"},

The adds aren't too much either, just close your WiFi or data when you're reading, then turn it back on when you search for new stories. Paid stories are necessary for authors, it's to support them financially. It's optional and it ain't like they're forcing you to spend money to read their books. There are plenty other options.

I've had an account for maybe 3 or 4 years? I recently made a new one though to separate fanfictions from real stories because it makes handling it all easier. My suggestion is that you create a link for multiple profiles.

It makes it so much easier to quickly switch from one to the other with a single press, like how Instagram does it. No one else can get to account 2 through your account 1 if you don't want them to, of course, so the option to switch accounts will be completely private, especially if they're under different emails."},

For example, I could be reading a book and then would want to switch to audio during commutes or other times when I cant read but listen. In such cases if I've to find the place where I need to start it's pretty difficult. You need to keep on forwarding and backward until you find the place which takes almost most of the time. 2. The app just can't preserve the last heard place. Whenever I stop listening and want to pick it at end of the day, the audio would be gone so long back. Knowing that I would just sometimes close the app as it would take forever to find the previous place as it doesn't even have chapters.. It's like a lengthy audio with no markings to find things. I'll buy if once these are fixed."},

This is the only provider that has wide variety of Marathi audio books that I was not able to find anywhere else. I was only interested in Marathi books and recently Storytel added a subscription option for Marathi only content at even less monthly subscription price. That's really awesome. App is also good, never hanged or created any issues. New audio player is better than last one and I am sure the team would be improving the player further. Short stories are excellent and there are frequent new releases. These are really good if you want to have a quick fun read/listen and lighten your mood or learn something new quickly. Statistics section is also good to understand your listening habits. 5 Stars for providing us with such a good variety of audio books and podcasts. Few things that can make the app better 1- Support for web based player so that we can also use it on PC. 2- Pause the audio when there is a notification on mobile. The app currently keeps audio playing in background if there is a notification. Most of audio apps pause the audio and after the notification sound, resumes the audio 3- Increase library content for latest English audio books (there are review or summaries available for latest books but feel that there is lack of latest English content compared to other providers). 4- Separate section for podcasts and books. Right now podcasts are mixed with books which for me is bit confusing. I start listening thinking that it is a book and then realize that its actually a podcast 5- Maybe have a modern color and look for the app. Current app works great, but looks a bit outdated. Also add support for light and dark modes 6- If possible, add option to buy books so that we can keep them forever and can listen to them anytime later even if the subscription expires. Also, search feature needs improvements. If I search for something, usually there are no results. Every time I have to depend on the curated lists or book tips section to find something that I would like to listen."},

When used on the Vision the phone compass / gyro seem to be disabled - not only for Sky Map but for every other app on the phone that uses the gyro and the compass.

The free mode is good enough so far. For more options you can always go for premium. The coolest things for me about this app was how smoothly it worked on my phone, it would show a list of contents with the page no. So that one can easily access those topics. I've only found this option to not work for one book so far. Maybe coz it wasnt a digital book/ had scanned pages. 1 thing I couldnt figure out was d highlight option mayb isn't free."},

I read a lotttt, so this is really helpful. It has all the features like night and day mode, font size, line spacing, vertical and horizontal view lock,etc. It has it All. I know i m getting old because the simple feature of 'series' makes me soo excited, its where the books of the same series automatically make a seperate folder and I don't have to make it for each series. Highly recommended."},

If we cleack on the location of a particular highlight in notion, it should take is to the book and exact line where it is highlighted from). Also it would be great if I could store notes online in 'Notion' or 'google drive'. Thank you."},
