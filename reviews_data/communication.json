Provides various facilities like calls, video calls, gorup group calls over internet, etc. You can hide status messages, delete messages and can report or block people.

There is also a function which allows the recieved.of the message to only see the pic once and then delete the whole thing. I recommend it."},

I ve not had any issues using Samsung Internet. I ve not had any glitches or security issues just good, easy, fast, reliable internet. Since then we ve had several updates....... .....I used to be able to access Amazon through the app or online through the net. Yes I said USED TO, no more. If I need to browse Amazon etc I have to borrow daughters iPhone. I don't have any issues with any other apps. Even eBay runs smoothly, just Amazon. Samsung sort it out!!!"},

Their browser has some great features some browsers lack like text/page zoom, a true dark mode and being able to sync my bookmarks to my Chrome browser on my desktop PC via an extension and for the most part their browser is good, it's only when using Dex mode that I run into problems. The first one is that on some websites I'm unable to make purchases (like on Ebay) where it says my browser is not supported. The second issue is that websites in Dex mode often load automatically into their mobile version and the button to switch between desktop/mobile just doesn't work. Something else that I find quite irritating is that when on YouTube I cannot switch to another tab without the video pausing, something that doesn't happen in Chrome or Edge. I've since tried Microsoft Edge and Chrome and while both are not perfect perform a lot better in Samsung's Dex mode than their own browser does which is shocking. I'm seriously considering switching back to Chrome as a result of this. If it wasn't for how problematic Samsung Internet is in Dex mode I would certainly give them five stars but right now it's too buggy."},

Edge's dark mode works better than Samsung Internet and Chrome on some websites. Edge's tab bars are more compact. I can watch YouTube videos and switch tabs without videos pausing, something that happens in Samsung Internet. Edge respects your privacy more. The only issue I have is that on the odd occasion the browser will freeze and do not use Edge outside of Dex mode because I don't like the layout and lack of option to customise it like I can with Samsung Internet so that remains my default browswer. I prefer the option to have certain buttons at the bottom of the browser rather than opening setting everytime and I like having a tab bar.

The UI seems to be \"waiting\" for the SMS to be \"send\", the period during which the App hangs completely. Still better than the rest of the apps out there mainly because it can auto delete older OTP and promotional msgs. Thanks a lot to the folks over at Microsoft India. Cheers."},

App has intelligence to identify OTP messages and show OTP only. Other helpful feature is ability to delete conversation easily with the delete icon on top. There are many other features but I am only mentioning the ones I found most useful. A minor quirk was that that SMS notification used to turn the screen on, while I don't want the screen to be turned on by notification to save battery. It turned out there is an option in the app to turn on screen when notification is received, and this is enabled by default. I suggest to developers to keep it off by default or take the system-wide setting or ask the user the preference at the first run of the app."},

Another good one from Firefox dev team. This is a small but essential app to browse internet with single click privacy button. Three cheers to that. However, there are some serious UI flaws, if can be addressed, will make it more user friendly. 1. The delete button is a fixed one and it's accidentally pressed several times while clicking \"top\" button of any website. It should be movable over the screen, where user wants it to be on a page. Or at least in the centre. 2. The multiple tab is seriously not so useful and its not only tough to switch tabs but they reload every time you use them.. kills the reason why it should be there at the first place. 3. No night mode option. It can be added without making it heavy. 4. The notification tray automatically erase when clicking on it. It should either open the app or do nothing, letting the user choose between the options. But it just deletes everything, which makes the feature pretty useless. That's annoying. Please look into these issues once and I will come up with a better rating. Promise!"},

Transactions and Promos get automatically sorted in different folders. The logic is not perfect and I can just mark a thread as Personal, Txn, Promo or Junk. It then corrects itself for future texts. Reminders is awesome - I can see my travel bookings, due payment reminders, all in one place and I get notifications ! The notifications (sometimes) have a direct link to the next step - payment site or airline's check-in page! It also shows me upcoming & past orders to track and return Finance - shows me all bank, card and wallet records in one place. There's a section for \"Offers\" that shows all coupons - it even gets coupons from the web !!!

I use it for captioning accommodation, but if I have to take down a quick note, it stops generating text until it's brought to the front again.

The app is handy as I've needed something to communicate with my dad who suddenly lost his hearing. The transcription accuracy is ok, but the thing that really makes this difficult to use is the lack of a simple pause button.

Can be used for reading what's being said on the computer when the phone is near its speakers. This app's long-term display of captions are often easier to process than the fleeting, live ones. However, pre-written captions are generally better than any live captioning process. Live captioning can edit itself and change the meaning after hearing new content which can change the rhetoric. Also, not every word is accurate whereas pre-written captions have been tailored for time and accuracy. Using this during the pandemic where lip-reading isn't possible has opened doors where only asking people to drop their masks was the only option. Thank you."},

I am also experiencing issues as to why we cant type too long of texts. I think users should be able to write long paragraphs instead of having to do separate texts if one is too long.

What I can't get past is the fact that Snapchat on Android looks so utterly different and is so much less user friendly than what my iPhone friends have. We're missing features in the Android version that are so easy to implement that there is no reason they shouldn't already be a part of the app. For example, I was just on a video call with a friend and found out that while on Android, we only have that tiny little circle, where you can barely see whats showing on the other person's screen, the Apple version has basically the same design as FaceTime. You can see the whole of what the other person sees, you can make your own video the focus, it overall just looks better and is easier to use. There's no reason whatsoever that the versions should be noticeably different. A large portion of the app works in very similar ways, whether it just looks better on Apple or it functions significantly better. The Android version even fails to include a dark mode, which the Apple version has had for a few months already. We've gone through multiple updates on our side and still can't even add a feature as simple as a dark mode? Overall, Snapchat just works better on Apple and its infuriating. There's no reason we can't have the same quality of application that the Apple crowd has access to, aside from the camera of course."},
