The largest issue is the games rediculous prices. Today I opened up the game and what do you know, a character offer was in the store for 80$."},

My only gripe is that recently they have been putting me up against players that are twice my rank so one shot or arrow or bow...even the stampede kills me on the spot.

Once I was able to go through the \u201cearth\u201d while flying vertically down on the wing suit, and turned up in the \u201cunderworld\u201d. When wingsuit was over, my avatar was just stuck there, in the air, constantly doing a slight twitching movements. I was stuck on the spot (distance didn\u2019t increase), but apparently time went on, because after a while standing there I completed my \u201cSurvive a full day\u201d quest. 3.

You can tell whenever you have ai players in your team, they roam around aimlessly and shoot more infrequently.

Since the game keeps asking for my opinion, here it is. The game is really fun, you can get lost for a while playing this. But the replayability of the game is low. Some people enjoy fighting through the exact same level 40-50 times to get strong enough to get to the next level, but if you can't buy skips or don't have the time or patience for hours of gameplay everyday then this isn't for you. You aren't going to compete in the multiplayer. Give that dream up. Graphics are really good. The controls are pretty good, but they can get unresponsive at times. My suggestions for the developer(s) is to create more non-story content (not pvp). I enjoy the survival mode more than anything else, but if you look at the leaderboards....11+ hours are the best times in that mode. Come on. That needs fixing because 99.9999% of the human population doesn't have more than an hour or two at most to spend doing one particular thing (lest we have to remind people that most people have other things to do besides playing games). I'm fairly low level and I can run survival for 40 minutes. I won't be doing anything but skipping that from now on, skip availability pending; and so diminishes my favorite part of the game. I like what the devs have made here, but there are some serious issues that need to be addressed here for the sake of longevity of your game. I'm not writing a thesis paper here, so excuse me for not doting on the graphics (which truly are very nice) or other parts of the game I like. End note, the game is a lot of fun but will become monotonous fairly quickly. Enjoy while it lasts."},

There is no reason that different characters are both locked behind a level (which that part is okay) and are something you have to make a new character for, which costs a lot of currency they dont tell you about in their sad excuse of a tutorial, or you can just spend 99 cents. The game's tutorial tells you barely anything about some rather useful mechanics, such as equipping new gear or what different menus are for. On top of it all, the game has no variety. You can play it almost as if it were a clicker game, since you're just hitting the attack button most of the time anyways, and you dont start with any skills like the ones you use at the first mission of how to play. All in all, not a worthwhile game. Especially considering rediculous way to get characters. Again, tutorial doesn't tell you about it either."},

Its getting appetite breaker. one less star for not bringing new map and different events."},

The play is certainly smooth and enjoyable to watch. Unfortunately, I'm not playing games to just watch what happens on screen, I'm paying games to be engaged, and this game suffers from a complete lack thereof, as you'll spend most if not all of your time in auto combat, as there's really no complexity or strategy to combat to begin with but strike and block. I would hardly call this a game of any sort. My biggest issue with the game that I haven't bothered to get involved in is the paid portion. This is consistent across mobile games, that you're sure to be charged positively absurd amounts of your livelihood for absolutely minor product. I wouldn't even call it product, cause it certainly won't last. $100 for 50k gold when I made 20k in a few hours? Even if it took me longer, ARK survival evolved is on sale for $20 right now, and never have to pay another dime, and THAT is a REAL game. This is just pretty.

No more weapon upgrades. Balance the weapons more so they aren't rendered completely useless upon leveling up. Variety is good in a game. Give players incentive to continue using certain weapons despite what level they are. Make armor upgrades free, unlocked once you've reached the necessary level. This change doesn't render armor useless because certain items have an effect on armor. Gunbucks and gold will only be used to purchase cosmetics, grenades and health packs. If the above changes were made to this game, it would boost it's popularity greatly while also increasing the game's longevity. For players that have already spent real money on the game, give them Gunbucks and gold that they can spend on cosmetics, and offer refunds to those requesting. Chances are a lot of the people who put money into the game probably don't even play anymore, so the payout wouldn't be that much. In the end, it's a small price to pay for the huge profits you can get from this game moving forward. Another option is to double the speed at leveling up upon the purchase of the game at $5. With the mechanics I laid out above, this wouldn't hurt anyone or be a pay 2 win mechanic."},

But as time goes the energy to payoff, becomes less and less worth it. The best guns are locked behind casino loot box nonsense. Much worse than pay to play. Aspects of the game make no sense ie costume and perks. No control over level or game play style.

One is were when you want to change your special ability you have to pay ruby but if you select the special skill and then tap out of Kahn.... you'll get the special skill even if you have insufficient ruby!

They come in vanity crates only and they cost 600 diamonds to get. Should change the game as you advance in levels you should be rewarded with masks and different guns."},

I was able to finish most of the missions, after which it is not letting me go forward, no mission pops up after it, I try to attend the briefing and all it does is asks me to go away and not disturb the guy. I don't if its a trick by developer to force you to pay for the game or something else, but its annoying. Other issues: Game does not play in full screen, there are big black bars on both side which takes up half of the screen estate, and its not as involving due to this sole reason. In some missions you are forced to play with some outside help, meaning you will have 2 to 3 bot allies who will accompany you, and its a real pain in the ass. A mission which you will be able to finish off way faster and better, gets you killed due to those fools, you cant ask them to stop or halt and execute some silent kills. This feature should be added, where we can control the allies movement so it does not end up getting us killed. My advice to whoever struggling because of it will be just get them ambushed and take some cover, once they are killed don't revive them until the end of the mission."},

Much realtic. But at some instant the game is not moving forward because reduction in stars, limitations of guns , cool down time of guns, not enough stars for the next level, also no of levels are very low. Even when we are boosting a weapon only one or two features of it is increasing not others like cool down time, reloading time which is a big drawback ."},

It has a good balance with grindiness and difficulty, it's pretty grindy but it's not that difficult so you get a lot of gameplay and a lot of time slaying zombies, but in order to get better weapons you need to watch a few ads or pay money, but that's not a big problem since events give you good enough rewards.

No change in stars, I gave it 4/5 then because I felt it had potential, and I feel it's mostly reached it's potential in the 3 years since launch, feeling like a pretty solid 4/5. It still has issues, and while freebies are plentiful monetization is still heavy, but the positives outweigh the negatives. It's also stuck in what I refer to as the \"mobile game art style,\" which is a smoooth, vaguely chibi but not quite anime style many mobile games use, which gives it a very generic look. Overall it's still better than a lot of mobile games, and while its popularity inspired a bunch of lazy knock-offs it also inspired some pretty good takes on its gameplay. [STILL CAN'T USE THE DEMON BLADE] A while ago, a melee weapon was introduced. It seemed to have a much lower drop rate compared to the rest, as the highest rarity I've achieved with it is great, while I have a page full of other gear at epic and perfect epic rarities. I played quite a bit after it was added, and was looking forward to using the game's first melee weapon, but I would have to play much older and less beneficial content because I just don't have a high enough rarity of it to use in the content I'm currently at. The option to simply buy a high rarity demon blade was offered, but it was obnoxiously overpriced. I don't know if I'll ever get a demon sword upgraded to at least epic so I can use it. [THOSE ADS ARE AWFUL] Despite producing a pretty good game, and despite that game being successful (I assume, since it hasn't shut down), ads for Archero have been produced in the frustrating and confusing style of misleading and often mocked-up gameplay that looks worse than the actual game.

Imagine in a sense project zomboid but on your phone. You have to grind to build weapons, supplies, and necessities. You build a base, find weapons, and just overall go loot. You will encounter other players in the forest for instance. They can try to kill you for your loot and you can kill them for theirs. You also can raid others bases however, I have yet to do that. Overall, I highly recommend this game!"},

It is just like RPS, easy to understand. However, the characters are very unbalanced. The connection issues plague the game most of the time.

This especially sucks since most of the gameplay is reacting to the opponent's attack, meaning if you have bad connection, you are delayed and your attacks get interrupted."},

In cases of a character needing a small amount of charge time before the move, the other player can counter attack, or block because they know what move is the better one"},

Often the app crashes. Make more maps and modes for more fun. And in Battle Royale mode increase the player limit to 20 or 30 then it would feel good. The matchmaking is worse. It matches me with beginners and the opponent's team have the highest rank players are there. Matchmaking should be made more relevant. Moreover very addictive game.

Since the update though the only way to get gems is with completing the little quests, but there aren't many. Watching an ad doesn't give you gems even though it says plus some amount, and the small amount of gems you collect in game you dont actually get unless you buy them for $14. Since theres no longer a good way to unlock vehicles I dont think I'll be playing this anymore. I'll leave my original review since the xp still is difficult to get. There are a few things I wish it did though. For the power ups, it would be nice if their timed activeness paused while in the special vehicles, and when you collect a power up you currently have active, it would reset the activated time instead of doing nothing. It's annoying for the double points or whatever to be going then stopping a moment after collecting a new double points power up just because the original one was on for another half second. I find it the most difficult to get xp for this game. Even if you race if you don't collect any xp pick ups you dont get any xp. I got stuck in a slump for a while because I used the mega power up and progressed to a new area level with a lower level car, and could never get up to another rival or xp cars to level up for the next car. It was so painfully slow and repetitive to progress. At most I was getting 40 xp from some pick ups that hardly dropped. It would be nice if you got an xp amount based on distance and enemies killed at the end of each race. And one last thing, being able to disable specific drones. I have maybe half them unlocked, but hate the rocket and shield drone. It shoots too slow and is useless later in the race, while the other let's you crash into only 2 cars max. They just block me from using a good drone. Overall, great game. I hope to see some new things thrown in later down the line. Maybe a new type of enemy vehicle mini boss, to switch it up a bit from what you have."},

Until 2 days ago the game was great. 2 days ago the in game ads for extra cash, diamonds, and game boosters changed, but also locked up and no longer gives the rewards for watching them. Without the benefit of rewards, you not only waste time watching them cause you cannot back out of them not even home screen button works, but it makes progression in the game extremely slow. I deleted the game today because there is no way to get ahold of support to correct this situation. I am not going to be forced to waste my time with ads and no benefits as well as stuck at my level it takes all the fun out of the game. Parts of the game that should be removed or changed, in my opinion: 1) the stupid overpasses that block your view 2) the missiles launched at road block choke points, the impossible ones I seemed to always get that hit as I entered choke point. 3) the vehicles that constantly shoot rearward, they follow your every move. 4) the number of rear shooting vehicles in 1 screen 5) the fact that at about 1 minute mark, you can no longer destroy any vehicle other than hitting them and after hitting 5, you are dead. I am at max front and side guns and max armor. But am, according to the game, moving too fast for ammo to hit and destroy the targets. 6) constant road blocks. Remove about half of the road blocks and it would be more fun"},

It's a great pick up anytime you have a free few mins free.

Ten pounds/bucks is not a cheap purchase for a mobile game that whilst pretty, a good implementation etc is still just one of many around.   Yes, you can play for free and I do but if those transactions were one or two quid I and many others would just pay without too much thought.

Why give me two health trucks when as soon as the game starts then barely give me any as the level goes on, same with special weapons/features. Yall give us so many when the level starts and then tapers off as you get further and further. Upgrading my cars should make you last longer or kill bosses faster, its actually the opposite. Your basic version of the car seems better and stronger.

I would like to humbly suggest some changes: 1) Don't make the car explode when crashing roadblocks from the side. I think suffering damage is more realistic than gettin' totalled. Like, as long as you are touching the roadblock (from the side), you continue to lose health. 2) More ways to get XP. XP power-ups are not enough. At least 1 point for every car destroyed, 2 points per truck, 3 points per armored truck and 1 point for every item collected in collect missions. Have in mind that reducing the chance to improve may lead players to dump the game. 3.1) Allow players to go back to previous bosses (even for less prizes) to give older cars a chance. Every time you get a new car, the previous ones are pretty much dumped. Being able to repeat missions would allow players to continue upgrading older cars and still competing for something. or 3.2) Allow players to sell older cars for cash and/or XP and/or gems.

At some points it starts getting sluggish but picks up pace again. Occasional bugs, runs mostly fine. It isn't pay-to-win, but it is difficult. A large personal annoyance is that when I download it, it makes it seem as though it's 3 times the data it actually takes up, forcing you to delete tons of your other apps. Then, once installed, it only takes up a gigabyte. Happens every update. Get it if you want, I don't care. But fix that KABAM, please."},

It's really upsetting when you have the game play for you and it works perfectly fine for computer vs computer but the moment I start play it doesn't work!
