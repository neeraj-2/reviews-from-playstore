It is designed in the exact way I needed. I'm just a beginning and they don't charge any fee which is very impressive and the voice guide helps a lot and it's quite helpful also. The water drinking tracker is my favourite. It reminds me to drink water and sets a goal of drinking 8 glass everyday. And also I like the way they have sorted the exercises. Thumps up!!!!"},

It tracks my water consumption and makes sure that I am comfortable with the workout plan! It also gives 30 second breaks between each excercise and lets us either skip the break or add 20 seconds if we need more time to rest.

It also tells us how to make our positions better or what to do for better results for the excercise! Will definitely recommend!"},

Great Studio experience. - It gives a wonderful balance between choosing strength and cardio, or yoga, which many apps may not give. 4. Polite coaching system. Addresses coaching related queries promptly, and up to their ability. Cons: 1. Toll free number does not work for any technical issues. 2. Raising a concern or issue was not also working 3. If you're slightly late for your studio work-outs due to technical issues or just for joining late due to fast-paced tight schedules at work, beyond 5 minutes, you are prevented from entering, and this I personally feel is wrong. This is a serious issue and needs to be rectified. All users who have booked the session have to be allowed to enter the studio work out sessions irrespective of being late or not. 4. Scheduling a call, is a wonderful system to let your coaches know when your will be free to receive their call, however there are times when the coaches call you directly. I never minded it, however there are other users who felt it to be annoying, as they might be in the middle of a class or some important meeting. I guess, all calls must be mutually agreed upon. This system also needs pruning to make the users comfortable. After all, this is a great app, but needs a lot of improvement."},

It is a great way to know if you've had sufficient amount of everything like fiber and fat and carbs and proteins. I also love how Indian food is available in the database, which is often updated. But I'm not sure how much to rely upon the value parameters of those food items. A simple example which leads me to judging the correctness of the values is the difference between the nutrition values for 'Subway Salad' and the nutrition values if I enter individual elements of that salad separately. I would have loved it more if there was a separate section to just find out the details about a particular food item instead of having to check it by inserting it in one of my meals.

I think it will be extremely beneficial if one takes this seriously and genuinely wants to undergo any sort of transformation for the better.... Way to go!!! improving the rating to 5 star just for the sheer professionalism and compassion of the response"},

The app has a LOT of content, divided into sections with multiple subsections, but there is no clear guidance on how to use it, or the correct order on where to begin your meditation journey. The music is far too loud which makes it hard to hear the voice that is guiding the meditation, & there is no way of adjusting it, other than to add additional instruments or sounds which make it even louder.

Only improvements I would suggest would be the option to enable Google Fit or similar data sharing (categorising breathing as meditation would be good enough if there is no breathing category) as well an option to choose an expanding & contracting ball or sun animation during practice. In particular the app's dynamic mode was very useful for my Resonance Frequency Breathing practice as while this breathing pattern is quite simple in normal practice (with a fixed breathing rate, and according to some recent research as well as my own personal testing with equal length inhales & exhales as this actually maximises your Heart Rate Variability or HRV, not longer exhales contrary to a lot of suggestions) you do need to find your ideal breath rate (resonance frequency where your HRV is maximised) and possibly also re-assess it regularly according to some research (personally mine hasn't varied much between assessments). Personally I found that the best way to assess my resonance frequency was to shift through a range of frequencies without pausing or interrupting the practice and so I needed an app which could automatically vary the breath rate every 2 minutes. Using this app's Dynamic mode you can create such a multiple rate pre-set program quite easily."},

I have been using this app to track my runs since October 2017. Of late I'm facing serious problems. - The location service is not working, even though other apps like maps or cab apps work fine. Nike is unable to detect my location. - The audio feedback which I used to get during my runs has stopped. - The app crashes several times mid run. - The pause function doesn't work sometimes. - There are times I run 10k+, but while updating the run, distance changes to 7 or 6k and the time remains the same. This messes up the recorded pace. When I edit the run to get the distance correct, I am unable to see the run details like splits and pace. These problems occur mid run, so I have to stop and try to fix them. I relaunch the app, reboot the phone, turn off and turn on location and mobile data services, etc. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. It becomes very frustrating as I spend 5-10 mins trying to fix these problems and can't concentrate on my run. There are times I have to helplessly give up and carry on.

It crashes at times. If you press the pause button, sometimes it doesn't resume and starts from the begining. Sometimes I like to play at 1.5x speed or 2x speed but its not possible to do it with the player in the app.  2. The other main frustration is you cannot identify the media from the download list because it shows only part of the name. I download some media for offline viewing/listening when I am travelling to work on the underground. For example I downloaded audios Gyan Yoga- Part 1, Gyan Yoga- Part 2, and so on. When I see the listing it shows me all the names as \"Gyan Yoga- Part...\" so its impossible to tell which part it is. It shows only first few letters of the title."},

I work in an open-concept office and it is vital to me that any app I use be inconspicuous. Rootd is that and more! The app provides a breathing and visualization tool that I like to use on a daily basis to help regulate my symptoms. The app also includes the Rootr tool, which offers two methods of relief during a panic attack. You can use the Rootr tool to read or listen to true facts about panic attacks that help ground you in the moment and remind you that you will be ok. The Rootr tool can also be used to develop the skills of radical acceptance of the feelings of anxiety. I haven't found another app that embraces this concept and helps teach you how to develop the skills to apply.  The only thing I would change would be to add a place that you can track specific goals within the app. It would be nice if you could leverage the stats feature of the app to track specific goals."},

First of all, the UI is completely unintuitive, and is a nightmare to navigate. I bought two watches for my two kids, and all I wanted to do was connect them to my account. It took me 30 minutes of trying to navigate the UI to even figure out how -- e.g. clicking on \"add device\" does *not* take you to an add device screen, it leads you down a rabbit hole of other screens without ever giving you the option of actually adding a device. BTW, I am a software engineer by profession, so this is not stupidity on my part. My wife had the same problem; we were both swearing by the end of it. , Once I finally figured out how to (supposedly) add multiple child accounts, and connect a device to a particular account, it simply refused to connect. Bluetooth showed \"searching for device\", but never found one. Troubleshooting helpfully asks if the watch is on. Yes it is on!! Multiple tries, rebooting the watch, turning bluetooth on and off, nothing. We tried with two different phones and a tablet, nothing. It couldn't find either either of the two watches. Since multiple hardware failures are unlikely, I blame the app. What a total piece of garbage. I will never buy a fitbit ever again. Unfortunately, I can't return the devices, so I am throwing them both in the trash."},

One advice: train with the app, but get yourself a decent watch in case the app suddenly decides to betray you. I don't recommend on race day!"},

The excerises are straightforward and it gives you some idea of a program which will work for you. However, the logging is terrible. Workouts you finish often don't show up as finished.

They were either too simplistic, took too long to build, weren't tailored enough, or made tracking reps in the gym a pain. In most cases, all of the above. As a result, I spent a lot of time with the notes app. This program has been a game-changer for me. After a week of use, it began to regularly give a challenging workout. It's infinitely adjustable to wherever I need it to be. It's also easy to log a set by pressing the enormous orange button (which could be bigger!). Above all, it builds workouts using the gym equipment I have (or these days, at home). Absolutely great, and the expense of a yearly subscription is well worth it."},

You may personalize your workout by adjusting the length, picking available equipment, and replacing out activities that you don't enjoy. I really like your product, therefore here are some updates I'd like to see in the future: Set a weight-loss goal: I exercise at home and have some equipment, but I can't always gain weight without buying more. It would be fantastic to be able to set the maximum weight for each piece of equipment and then have the algorithm recommend alternate regimens or ways to make it more difficult with what's available. Activity preferences and/or skills: tagging an exercise so you can perform it more often is beneficial; this goes hand in hand with practicing a skill, such as a handstand. As a result, the algorithm would be forced to include it in the proper workouts. While the prescribed activity will grow repetitious after a while, it would be fantastic to be able to quickly create a fun/surprise training in which you simply try different exercises for that session. Of obviously, this is a lower priority than the others."},

The algorithms used can work on the complete body (however I do believe that core work is overemphasized in every workout day after day). To put it another way, there will never be a \"perfect\" AI workout app that caters to everyone's preferences.

I couldn't understand what action I am supposed to do, so it\u2019s \u2018keep trying till it works\u2019 kind of thing. 2) while the exercise library is pretty sizeable, I would like to see more exercises like the kettlebell halo or some sandbag exercises. Yeah, yeah, never convinced. 3), Also, I would like to add the option to add custom exercises to the library instead of number 2. Give me an exercise guide and let me attach all the one off variations that I want. We use the app couple of times a week. It\u2019s awesome to share a workout. It is very comfortable for us to warm-up together and track the workout on our own devices. Really good job. Waiting for news coming next."},

You have really good back workouts spread across the other workouts - just bundle them (maybe add 1-2), done. 2. The \"Well done, congratulations!\" voice gets muffled in the end (I guess so the following ad can have full attention?) Please play the Well done sound loudly as it is such a rewarding experience. Then I am much more happy / attentive to watch/listen to the following ad. 3. Studies show that Waist-to-height ratio is more accurate than BMI when looking at obesity problems. Maybe you want to consider swapping or addting waist to hip. 4. It would be nice if (during the last seconds of the) current workout, the one coming up would be previewed so you can get mentally ready for the next one.

You wanna feel the burn, but don't push too hard. 2) don't skip the workouts and don't try to modify them to be super easy for you.

I particularly like how if we miss a day, it wont show as a big red cross, but it rather accumulates the days we exercised on the calendar. The only reason that I am not giving a 5 star rating is because of an ad I saw just now.

I'm not great, I only did one 30-day challenge at medium level but I can see the results without making any other dietary changes in my daily routine. Definitely recommend it to try."},

The only  suggestion for improvement is maybe instead of getting a notification  saying that you should exercise, the notification can roughly estimate the time it will take you to complete the exercise for that day. Just something I'd like to see, to get motivated EVERY day. We all know it is hard to stay continuously motivated so anything you can do to change that would be perfect."},

The selection in training certain parts of the body is good, & the easy, medium, hard choices. It has audio & visual so very good if you're not looking at the phone You don't need much space & if you have a mat you're good to go. First few days the set of exercises are short, I often do 3 sets until they get longer. I like it so far.. and have already shared with my friends."},

It's really welcoming (easy) for the first few days but it gradually gets more challenging as you progress further. My only complaint is that from my experience (at level Medium 1) at the last few days of the challenge it just increased the repetitions and the number of exercises and not the actual intensity. As a result it made the experience a little dull and it's not so great for someone who aims to gain muscle mass."},

Starting from easy and reaching hard takes months but it is worth it. I didn't want to lose weight just get back in shape and strengthen my muscles. And in 2 months time I got the results I wanted. It is a great app. Ads pop on just in then end of the program so they're not annoying. It does have instructions and links to videos for exercises. Overall is a really good app!"},

I've only tried their full body workout material so I can't speak for the rest of their workouts. I think the instructional videos are a great addition as sometimes it's difficult to figure out the movements from only a picture. However, I wish there was consistent information about the exercises we were doing. If you click on details, some exercises do mention what part of the body they're targeting, some tips to do it well but not all."},

This is the first app I've been able to stick to purely due how quick the sessions are and the ability to choose a focus area. I've been doing the full body, arms and booty 4 days a week and then abs and legs whenever I feel I need a little extra, and it's super great. They progress harder/longer as you go but it's not super noticeable as it kinda works with your progress. Ads are only at the end of each session and very quick. You don't need any equipment either!"},

The workouts are great and the video tutorials great as well. I use the free version and have never had a problem with ads, it's how the company makes money and I appreciate that. But, recently, the ads don't give the option to exit and you can't even start the exercise because there is no \"X\" to click on. This app has become essentially inoperable and I am disappointed. Please fix and I'll gladly change my review to 5\u2b50"},

You set the difficulty level and each day the app gives you daily exercises to do. It also has a meal planner in the free version suggesting meals and snacks daily. I've been inactive (230lb), and needed something to get me going again. The only drawback with free version is ads. You can pay for pro if you don't want them. UPDATE: I've completed the first 30 days and I can already feel and see a difference! Can't wait see results in next 30 days."},

The easy plan starts out soooooo low. Then it increases weekly, but only by a little. There are pictures and timers to help you. You can redo any day, if you aren't ready for more. It literally took 2 or 3 minutes to finish it. I had a huge mental block of exercise being too hard or taking too much time. This was exactly what I needed to build success!"},

I've tried gyms and programs.and they all failed, due to my busy life style. I roll out of bed and do the workout. Sometimes I do a second one the same day. It's well paced and easy to follow. It focuses on consistency, which is key to get in shape. However, I am not too keen about a recent update. the weight graph and the calendar tracker are on the fritz. Since I use both frequently it interferes with my tracking."},

It started easy and the difficulty raises adequately, not abrupt nor too slow. Then changes in my body shape started to be noticeable. I was amazed by the results from the bit of investment I put in. Great app to start, not to get out off exercising. I hate the feeling of dying when exercising. I have recommended this app many times, and will keep doing so."},

U can't wait until I finish 30 days on easy mode so I can move on to harder stuff! No workout equipment needed except for a yoga mat and occasionally a chair."},

If you find a level that feels right for the first week, the second or third week will be much too difficult for someone who is making realistic progress. I love the premise of this app, but I think it will discourage people who are working on getting back in shape. By setting an excessive pace, I think the app will cause most users to give up in 2-3 weeks."},

I have 3 alarms set per day, but if you ignore one, it stops sending notifications. I forgot to cancel after my free trial and was charged for a year, so I figured I should use it, but I never receive notifications reminding me to exercise.

It's been brilliant for home workouts in the school holidays when I've got children home and I can pick as many challenges as I have time for. It's simple to use, the format is user-friendly and the cues during exercises are helpful. Its got me in a great exercise routine and the rest days are spot on. I adapt the exercises to suit me, eg. I can't do press-ups so do them on my knees but I add weights to the exercises I find easier."},

They place way too much emphasis on the legs (many \"full body\" workouts are literally like 50% leg exercises) and the order in which you're supposed to do the exercises often doesn't make much sense either."}
